## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-29

### ðŸš€ Major Features Added

#### Direct Number Kill Commands
- **One-input kill**: Type just `2` to kill process #2 (instead of `k` â†’ `2` â†’ `y`)
- **Range support**: Kill multiple processes with `2-4` or `1,3,5`
- **Instant workflow**: Reduced 3-step process to 1 step for maximum efficiency

#### Enhanced TUI Interface
- **Beautiful colors**: Color-coded process types (Node=green, Python=blue, etc.)
- **Real-time stats**: CPU usage, memory usage, and uptime for each process
- **Smart port colors**: Port ranges color-coded (3000s=green, 8000s=blue, 4000s=yellow)
- **Improved formatting**: Clean table layout with proper alignment

#### Advanced Features
- **Multiple sort options**: Sort by port, PID, name, CPU usage, or memory usage (`s` command)
- **Toggle display modes**: Switch between basic and extended info (`t` command)  
- **Auto-refresh mode**: Continuous monitoring with `a` command
- **Enhanced help system**: Built-in help with `h` command
- **Better uptime display**: Human-readable format (e.g., "2d 18h 45m")

#### Configuration Options
- **Environment variables**: `DEVPORTS_EXTENDED`, `DEVPORTS_SORT`, `DEVPORTS_REFRESH`
- **Customizable defaults**: Set preferred sort order and display mode
- **Configurable refresh interval**: Adjust auto-refresh timing

### Changed
- **Simplified UI prompts**: Clear action indicators (`1-9=kill` vs previous complex syntax)
- **Enhanced status display**: Real-time filter, sort, and mode indicators
- **Improved confirmation dialogs**: More detailed process information before kill
- **Better error handling**: More informative error messages and fallbacks

### Fixed
- **macOS compatibility**: Fixed process stats collection for macOS `ps` command
- **Input parsing**: Resolved issues with direct number input recognition
- **Index mapping**: Fixed sorted display index resolution for accurate process targeting
- **Array handling**: Improved bash strict mode compatibility for empty arrays
- **Memory safety**: Enhanced error handling for edge cases

### Technical Improvements
- **Better architecture**: Separated concerns with helper functions
- **Enhanced parsing**: Robust selection parsing with range and comma support
